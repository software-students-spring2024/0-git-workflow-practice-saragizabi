I find it interesting that although there is emphasis on how good of a “coder” someone is, many of the concepts most important for a good programmer or software engineer deal with specific thought processes. For example, you can be the fastest to write code for a problem but still be a less effective way in comparison to a code that is easier to implement while also being less complex. This article is helpful in distinguishing the difference between a more vs less successful programmer and mentioning key concepts that can be more useful than knowing different methods/functions/languages, etc.

The passage emphasizes the qualities that make a good programmer. It stresses that programming is not solely about mastering a particular programming language; rather, it's about problem-solving skills, the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts, scenario analysis, effective naming and consistency, and continuous learning. These skills are considered essential for any programmer and are not tied to any specific programming language or technology. Therefore, I think it is not important which language a programmer has mastered in a team(such as c, java, python, etc.). The important thing is that he can communicate with others and successfully convey his ideas.
